Translation workflow:
- Regenerate .po files:
   $ tools/generatePo
   PLEASE NOTE: the generatePo recently does not extract texts from ovirt.html. Please extend it if you need to.

- Update headers in .po files

- Translate .po files

- Commit .po changes to git

------------------------------------------------
The po/LOCALES is a one-line, by space-separated list of locales for generating of both .po and .json files.

Each time the webpack build is executed, the .po files are converted to dist/i18n/*.json files which are loaded from JavaScript at runtime.
